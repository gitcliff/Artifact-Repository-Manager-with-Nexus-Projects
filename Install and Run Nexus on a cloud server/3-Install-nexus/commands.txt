# 📦 SUMMARY  
# This set of commands navigates to the /opt directory, downloads a compressed archive of Nexus Repository Manager, lists files in the directory, and extracts the downloaded archive.  
# Language/Platform: Bash/Linux shell commands  
# What you'll learn: How to change directories, download files from the internet, list directory contents, and extract tar.gz archives  
# Outcome: The Nexus Repository Manager archive is downloaded and extracted into the /opt directory  
# Why this matters: Setting up Nexus repository allows managing and hosting software artifacts, essential in development pipelines  

# ------------------------------  
# 🧩 SECTION TITLE: Change directory to /opt  
# ------------------------------  
cd /opt/  
# ✅ What it does: Changes the current directory to /opt, a common location for optional software installations  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Ensures you download and extract files in the right system directory for software

# ▶️ HOW TO RUN / EXECUTE THESE COMMANDS  
# ------------------------------  
# Bash/Linux shell:  
cd /opt/                             # ✅ Change directory to /opt where software will be installed  
                                    # 🧠 Necessary to keep system organized with standard locations for optional software  
wget https://download.sonatype.com/nexus/3/nexus-unix-x86-64-3.79.0-09.tar.gz  
                                    # ✅ Download Nexus installation package  
                                    # 🧠 Fetches the software needed for repository management  
ls                                  # ✅ Lists files to confirm the download succeeded  
                                    # 🧠 Helps verify the environment before extraction  
tar -zxwf nexus-unix-x86-64-3.79.0-09.tar.gz  
                                    # ✅ Extracts the archive contents into /opt  
                                    # 🧠 Makes the software ready for configuration or execution  

# PowerShell (Windows with WSL):  
# Use the same bash commands in a WSL terminal as above.  
# Alternatively, in native PowerShell without WSL, use:  
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://download.sonatype.com/nexus/3/nexus-unix-x86-64-3.79.0-09.tar.gz" -OutFile "C:\path\to\save\nexus-unix-x86-64-3.79.0-09.tar.gz"  
# ✅ Downloads the file via PowerShell  
# Extracting tar.gz can be done with 7-Zip or tar (if available):  
tar -zxvf "C:\path\to\save\nexus-unix-x86-64-3.79.0-09.tar.gz" -C "C:\desired\extract\folder"  

# ------------------------------  
# ✅ NOTES / GOTCHAS / TIPS  
# ------------------------------  
# - Make sure you have permissions to write in /opt (may need `sudo` before commands).  
# - `wget` requires network access and that the URL is reachable.  
# - The `tar` flags: `-z` decompresses gzip, `-x` extracts, `-w` writes files, `-f` specifies the archive file.  
# - On Windows without WSL, `wget` is not native, so use `Invoke-WebRequest` or tools like curl.  
# - Confirm the file downloaded correctly by comparing file size or checksums if available.
