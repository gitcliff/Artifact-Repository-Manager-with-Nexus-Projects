# 2 - Install and Run Nexus on a cloud server


# 📖 Summary

Worked on **2 - Install and Run Nexus on a Cloud Server**, focusing on setting up a centralized artifact repository using **Nexus Repository Manager**.
Tasks included creating a secure cloud server environment, installing Java and Nexus, configuring proper permissions, and enabling access through firewall rules to solve the challenge of managing build artifacts securely and efficiently in a DevOps workflow.
Set up a **DigitalOcean Droplet with SSH firewall rules and Nexus on port 8081** to automate and optimize artifact storage, aiming to streamline continuous integration and delivery pipelines with a private repository manager.
