# 📦 SUMMARY  
# This sequence installs the OpenJDK 17 Java Runtime Environment (headless version) on a Linux system, then checks the installed Java version.  
# Language/Platform: Bash/Linux shell commands  
# What you'll learn: How to install Java using apt package manager, verify Java installation and version  
# Outcome: Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 17 is installed without graphical components, and version info is displayed  
# Why this matters: Many applications require Java to run, and installing a headless version is efficient for servers without GUI  

# ------------------------------  
# 🧩 SECTION TITLE: Install Java Runtime Environment (JRE)  
# ------------------------------  
apt install openjdk-17-jre-headless  
# ✅ What it does: Installs OpenJDK 17 JRE without GUI-related libraries on your system using the apt package manager  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Provides a lightweight Java runtime environment suitable for server environments or CLI applications  

# ------------------------------  
# 🧩 SECTION TITLE: Verify Java Installation  
# ------------------------------  
java -version  
# ✅ What it does: Displays the currently installed Java version and related details  
# 🧠 Why it matters: Confirms Java was installed successfully and lets you verify the version for compatibility  

# ------------------------------  
# ▶️ HOW TO RUN / EXECUTE THESE COMMANDS  
# ------------------------------  
# Bash/Linux shell:  
sudo apt update                    # ✅ What it does: Updates package lists so apt knows about latest versions  
                                  # 🧠 Why it matters: Ensures you install the newest version of Java  
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre-headless  # ✅ What it does: Installs the OpenJDK 17 JRE headless package  
                                          # 🧠 Why it matters: Needed to run Java applications on your system  
java -version                    # ✅ What it does: Checks installed Java version to verify installation  
                                  # 🧠 Why it matters: Ensures you have the correct Java version installed  

# PowerShell (Windows, using Windows Subsystem for Linux or similar):  
# Run the same bash commands in WSL terminal or use an appropriate package manager for Windows like Chocolatey:  
# choco install openjdk17         # ✅ What it does: Installs OpenJDK 17 on Windows using Chocolatey  
# java -version                  # ✅ Same verification step for Windows  

# ------------------------------  
# ✅ NOTES / GOTCHAS / TIPS  
# ------------------------------  
# - Use `sudo` before `apt install` to run the installation with administrator privileges.  
# - "headless" means it does not install GUI-related libraries, ideal for servers without a graphical interface.  
# - If `apt` commands fail, you might need to run `sudo apt update` first.  
# - Verify your PATH includes Java binaries, or use full path to `java` if needed.  
# - On non-Debian based systems, use the equivalent package manager (e.g., yum, dnf).
