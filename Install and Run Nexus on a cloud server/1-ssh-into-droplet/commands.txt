# 📦 SUMMARY  
# This command establishes a secure shell (SSH) connection to a remote server using the username "root" and the server's IP address.  
# Language/Platform: Bash / PowerShell (SSH command)  
# What you'll learn: How to connect securely to remote servers using SSH, basic remote server access concepts  
# Outcome: You get logged into the remote server’s command line environment as the root user  
# Why this matters: SSH is essential for remotely managing servers securely over the internet or private networks

# 🧩 SECTION TITLE: Connect to remote server via SSH  
# ------------------------------  
ssh root@164.92.127.132  # ✅ What it does: Initiates an SSH session to a remote machine using the username "root"  
                        # 🧠 Why it matters: Enables secure remote access to manage and administer the server  

# ------------------------------  
# ▶️ HOW TO RUN / EXECUTE THIS COMMAND  
# ------------------------------  
# Bash/Linux/macOS shell:  
ssh root@164.92.127.132    # ✅ What it does: Connects you securely to the remote server as root user  
                          # 🧠 Why it matters: This is how you remotely manage the server via terminal  

# PowerShell (Windows):  
# You can run the same command in PowerShell if you have SSH client installed:  
ssh root@164.92.127.132    # ✅ What it does: Same as above, connects to the remote server securely  
                          # 🧠 Why it matters: Windows PowerShell supports SSH clients to connect remotely  

# If SSH client is not installed on Windows, you can:  
# 1. Use Windows Terminal or Command Prompt with OpenSSH installed (available on Windows 10+ by default).  
# 2. Use PuTTY GUI tool to connect via SSH, where you enter username and IP in the PuTTY interface.  

# ------------------------------  
# ✅ NOTES / GOTCHAS / TIPS  
# ------------------------------  
# - Replace "164.92.127.132" with your server’s actual IP address or hostname.  
# - Avoid logging in as root directly if possible; use a less privileged user and sudo for security.  
# - Make sure your SSH keys or passwords are set up correctly to avoid login failures.  
# - If you see "Permission denied," check your credentials or SSH key setup.  
# - Use `ssh -i path/to/private_key root@164.92.127.132` if your server requires a key file.
